    <h1>NetNote</h1>

    This is simple websocket application to send text messages.
    Purpose of this tool is to allow users to append text messages to the network traffic of their local network.

    <h2>How it works?</h2>

    By default, this form sends the contents to `example.fi`, but you can change the address to anything you wish, or
    select "random" to randomize the domain each time the message is sent.
    Type something to the input field and press "Send" to send it

    <hr>

    <h2>Is it safe?</h2>

    There is no encryption applied on the sent message. This means that everything you type is sent in plain text. This
    is a security risk, as anyone can read the messages you send.
    However, this is a feature, not a bug. The purpose of this tool is to allow users to append text messages to their
    network traffic. Encrypting this traffic would be counterproductive.

    <form id="message_form">
        <input type="text" id="message" name="message">
        <input type="submit" value="Send">
    </form>
